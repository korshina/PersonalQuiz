Code for the Personality Quiz project in the App Development with Swift course from Apple

# Quick Overview

- The first is an introduction screen with information about the quiz and a button to begin.
- The second view controller displays a question and several answers, and manages the responses. This view controller is refreshed for each question, and depending on what kind of question you ask, the right controls will be displayed.
- The third view controller tallies up the answers and presents the final outcome. This result can be dismissed, allowing another player to start the quiz from the first view controller.
